# Wk6_Coding_Assignment
# This program is a simplified version if the Game of War
# It allows users to add two names, players 1 and 2
# When the game is run, the deck is shuffled and dealt to both players
# Then they take turns flipping the top card of their hand and comparing them to see who won the round
# After both players flip their card, the current score is printed

# The script does not utilize the card class, each card and deck are created manually
# This was a fun little project for our final Java coding assignment and wrap up the unit
# Feel free to reach out if you have any questions - alexandra.davis333@gmail.com
